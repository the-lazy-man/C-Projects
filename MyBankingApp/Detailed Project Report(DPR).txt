Detailed Project Report (DPR):

1.Introduction:

 >Title: Banking Application
 >Purpose: Create a console-based banking application to facilitate various banking operations.
 >Objective: To provide users with a simple and convenient way to manage their bank accounts.

2.Scope:

 >The project includes functionalities such as opening accounts, depositing cash, withdrawing cash, and checking balances.
 >Excludes advanced features like interest calculations, transactions history, and multi-account support.

3.Features:

Open Account:
 >Collects user's full name, date of birth, and phone number.
 >Displays a success message after account creation.

Deposit Cash:
 >Takes deposit amount as input and updates account balance.
 >Notifies the user of the successful deposit.

Withdraw Cash:
 >Prompts user for withdrawal amount and validates against account balance.
 >Completes withdrawal if sufficient funds are available.

Check Balance:
 >Displays the current account balance.

Exit:
 >Provides an option for users to exit the application.

4.Technology Stack:

Java programming language
Scanner class for input
Object-oriented design principles

5.Architecture:

 >Users interact with the BankApplication through a console interface.
 >The BankApplication manages user input and menu display.
 >The AccountHolder performs account-related actions.
 >Data flow: User input -> BankApplication -> AccountHolder -> Output

6.User Flow:

 >User launches the application.
 >User selects from menu options: open account, deposit cash, withdraw cash, check balance, or exit.
 >The application executes the chosen action. 
 >Results are displayed to the user.

 >Tested various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs.
 >Ensured the application behaved as expected.

9.Future Enhancements:

 >Implementing interest calculations and transactions history.
 >Enhancing user authentication and security.
 >Providing multi-account support for users.

10.Conclusion:

 >Successfully created a console-based banking application with core functionalities.
 >Gained valuable experience in Java programming and user interface design.
 >Identified areas for further improvement and expansion of features.
